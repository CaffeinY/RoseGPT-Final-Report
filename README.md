Hi, this is our final project git repository.

Due to the github repository file size restriction, we cannot upload our random forest model directly. Instead, we store it in google drive.
The link is https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y3SoZOdZEWTrAg5ntgxOU0-R3P8jERh4/view?usp=sharing

To reproduce the prediction on our model, and open the file `final_random_forest.ipynb` run all. The output will be in the file `submit_rf0.csv` stored in final.

`Main_final.ipynb` contains the deep learning models that we tried.
`result_analysis.ipynb` contains the result and analysis of different deep learning models
`EDA.ipynb` contains the exploratory data analysis on the original dataset.

More details in our final report.
